    "5. Which has more mass, the air in this classroom or the brains in this classroom?  \n",
    "6. On average, how many people are airborne in the world at a given moment?  \n",
    "7. How many total miles do all Americans drive in their cars in one year, and how does this compare to the circumference of the Earth ($2.5 \\times 10^4$ miles), the distance from the Earth to the Sun ($9 \\times 10^7$ miles), and size of the Solar System ($10^9$ miles)?\n",
