    "The model is a two-dimensional square $N \\times N$ array that represents the forested region we're simulating.  **The cells in the array can have three values:** \n",
    "- **0 (empty)** \n",
    "- **1 (trees)** \n",
    "- **2 (on fire)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the model, a user-specified fraction of the cells $f_\\text{trees_start}$ are randomly filled with trees and the remaining cells are empty.  \n",
    "**One edge of the board (say, the entire leftmost column) is set on fire.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhoods\n",
    "Each cell has a \"neighborhood\" that is composed of its four neighbors to the left, right, above, and below it. **If a cell is along one of the edges of the array, only consider the neighbors that it has** (i.e., don't try to go out of the bounds of the array).\n",

    "### Evolving with Time\n",
    "The model takes steps forward in time, where every cell is modified based on the previous step.  The model evolves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If the cell was empty last turn, it stays empty this turn.**\n",
    "* **If the cell is a tree and any of its neighbors were on fire last turn, it catches on fire.**\n",
    "* **If the cell was on fire last turn, the fire has consumed all of the trees and it is now empty.**\n",

    "### Ending Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model evolves forward in time until all of the fires have burned out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After this happens, you can calculate the fraction of the cells that still have trees at the end of the model ($f_\\text{trees_end}$) and the fraction of cells that are empty ($f_\\text{empty}$).  The fraction of burned cells, $f_\\text{burned}$, is just the difference between the fraction of cells that were initially trees and the fraction of cells that are trees at the end of the model; in other words,\n",

    "\n",
    "This model also demonstrates the concept of a \"critical threshold\" or a __\"tipping point\"__.  This is a phenomenon that occurs __when a small change in an input parameter results in a large change in outcome__.  This is a phenomenon that shows up in both simple and complex models and happens in such varied circumstances as forest fires, the spread of disease in populations, and the transfer of information within a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Finding the \"tipping point\"**\n",
    "In order to find the tipping point, i.e. the point at which the fire spreads much more substantially, we want to loop over many values of $f_\\text{trees_start}$ (say, values from 0.01 to 1.0, in steps of 0.01) and run the model many times.  If we keep track of the fraction of cells that are burned for each starting condition, we can show how $f_\\text{burned}$ and $f_\\text{trees_start}$ relate to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction of burned cells, $f_\\text{burned}$, is just the difference between the fraction of cells that were initially trees and the fraction of cells that are trees at the end of the model; in other words,\n",

To do this you need to take the default board, create a new board, and then return that new board where the positions of the fire have been updated. This new model should evolve as follows: empty cells stay empty, if a cell has a tree and its neighbours had fire, then that cell should also catch on fire, and lastly, if the cell was on fire the last turn then the fire has consumed all of the trees and should now be empty. This should create a model to show a forest catching on fire. "
